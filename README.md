# Driver Drowsiness Detection System

## Overview
This project implements a deep learning-based system for detecting driver behavior and drowsiness using computer vision techniques. The system can classify different driving states including dangerous driving, distracted driving, drinking, safe driving, sleepy driving, and yawning.

## Features
- Real-time driver behavior classification
- Multiple detection states:
  - Dangerous Driving
  - Distracted Driving
  - Drinking
  - Safe Driving
  - Sleepy Driving
  - Yawning
- Implements both CNN and VGG architectures
- Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance
- Data augmentation for improved model robustness

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset in the following structure:
   - Training data in `data/train`
   - Validation data in `data/valid`
   - Test data in `data/test`
   - Each directory should contain an `_annotations.txt` file

2. Run the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook Code/CNN&VGG.ipynb
```

## Model Architecture
The project implements two main architectures:

### CNN Model
- Multiple convolutional layers with ReLU activation
- MaxPooling layers for dimensionality reduction
- Global Average Pooling
- Dense layers with dropout for regularization
- Softmax output layer for classification

### VGG-like Model
- Sequential blocks of convolutional layers
- MaxPooling after each block
- Dense layers with dropout
- Configurable through hyperparameter tuning

## Training
- Input image size: 128x128 pixels
- Batch size: 32
- Data augmentation including:
  - Rotation
  - Width/Height shifts
  - Zoom
  - Shear
  - Horizontal flip

## Performance Optimization
- Early stopping to prevent overfitting
- Learning rate reduction on plateau
- Model checkpointing
- Hyperparameter tuning using Keras Tuner

## Results
- Model accuracy and loss plots are generated during training
- Classification reports show per-class performance
- Test set evaluation provides overall system performance
